Need to install the pexpect module.

If using the One Wire temperature sensor, you need to install that module.

Be sure to ssh into the miner manually once, to put the public key into knownhosts

If using the Temper USB temperature sensor:

https://github.com/padelt/temper-python
download zip

if needed:
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

run sudo python setup.py install
installs temper-poll in /usr/local/bin

copy 99-tempsensor.rules (in ../etc) to /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo cp 99-tempsensor.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

reboot
